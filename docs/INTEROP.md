# Mirrarium corpus JSONL export

`mirrarium corpus export [limit]` is a read-only interoperability surface for local consumers such as Chatarium.

## v1 framing

The command writes JSON Lines to stdout: one complete JSON object per conversation, ordered by `conversation_id`. With no limit it exports every derived conversation. A positive limit restricts the number of conversation records. There is no header line; every record is self-describing. The CLI streams records as they are composed while holding the generation lock; it does not materialize the full archive export in memory before writing. Peak export memory therefore scales with the largest single conversation record rather than the total number of conversations.

An export pins one published derived-corpus generation with a shared rebuild lock for the lifetime of the command. Multiple exports may run together, but `corpus rebuild` cannot replace the published generation until active exports finish. Normal browser capture remains independent and continues through the raw-store writer.

Conversation identity discovery includes snapshots, message observations, stream reconstructions, stream-message revisions, and attachment observations, so revision-only or attachment-only derived evidence is not dropped from the export.

Each v1 record has:

- `schema: "mirrarium.corpus.conversation"`
- `schema_version: 1`
- `producer_corpus_schema_version`: the internal rebuildable corpus schema version that produced the record
- `record_type: "conversation"`
- `conversation_id`
- `evidence`: the normal derived conversation evidence view, retaining source capture IDs
- `canonical`: the conservative canonical conversation view when safely derivable, otherwise `null`
- `canonical_error`: `null` on normal derivation, otherwise the canonicalization failure for this conversation
- `stream_revisions`: ordered stream-message revision evidence with source capture IDs
- `attachments`: attachment observations plus correlated captured downloads and their raw capture IDs

## Contract

The export schema version is independent of Mirrarium's internal SQLite schema version. Internal rebuildable schema changes do not change the JSONL contract unless the export `schema_version` changes.

The export is deliberately conversation-focused. WebSocket/EventSource transport-global views, skipped transport derivations, cache telemetry, and arbitrary raw capture bodies remain available through their dedicated Mirrarium inspection commands and are not silently folded into conversation records.

The exporter does not crawl ChatGPT, mutate the archive, or read new network data. It composes already-derived local evidence. It also does not include arbitrary decrypted CAS bodies beyond text/content already represented in the derived corpus.

The encrypted-at-rest guarantee ends at this explicit interoperability boundary: JSONL records written to stdout contain the private conversation/evidence text represented by the derived corpus in plaintext. Pipes pass that plaintext to the receiving process, and shell redirection creates an ordinary plaintext file with permissions determined by the shell/filesystem environment. Consumers such as Chatarium should treat the stream as sensitive local data and establish their own at-rest protections if they persist it.

Canonicalization is not authoritative over evidence. If canonicalization of one conversation fails, the exporter keeps that conversation's evidence and provenance and emits `canonical: null` plus `canonical_error` instead of aborting the entire JSONL stream. Structural corpus/read failures still fail the command.
